                                    <h3 class="title">Private Student Loans From Citizens Bank – Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>

                                    <div class="desc">
                                      <p>If you're among the many students entering college today, you might have realized that your federal student loans don't fully cover the cost of attending. While they can handle tuition and housing to an extent, other expenses like meal plans, books, and various college-related costs still remain. Thankfully, private lenders like Citizens Bank can provide alternative options.</p>
                                      <p>Despite federal financial aid's consistent maximum loan limits, the overall expenses, especially tuition fees, have continued to rise. Thus, while completing the FAFSA for government assistance remains essential, exploring private student loans becomes necessary. But how do you choose the right one? What do you need to understand about different lenders and their capabilities?</p>
                                      <p>Citizens Bank is a major player in private student lending, with many students opting for their services due to the familiarity of the name and the institution's stability in the coming years. However, is Citizens Bank truly the best choice? Let's delve into the Pros and Cons of Private Student Loans from Citizens Bank, their borrower benefits, and the implications of partnering with them.</p>
                                      <p>Pro – Competitive Interest Rates Interest rates are a major concern for students seeking loans. With private student loans from Citizens Bank, you're presented with a choice between fixed or variable rate loans. Variable rate loans range from 2.56% to 8.16%, fluctuating annually with the market. On the other hand, fixed rate loans range from 4.99% to 10%, remaining constant throughout your loan term unless you decide to consolidate or refinance.</p>
                                      <p>These rates are notably competitive, standing well in comparison to both other private lenders and federal loans. It's worth noting that PLUS loans have a capped interest rate of 10.5%. This means that even in a less favorable scenario where you receive the highest fixed rate interest from private student loans from Citizens Bank, it would still fall short of the maximum interest rate of a <a href="federal-loan.html">Federal</a> PLUS loan.</p>
                                      <p>Con – Required Waiting Period for Cosigner Release Conversely, if you're a student seeking a loan from Citizens Bank, you'll likely need a cosigner. While this is common practice, it can be a source of frustration. Some reviewers have expressed discontent over the mandatory 36-month waiting period for cosigners to be released from their obligations concerning Private Student Loans From Citizens Bank.</p>
                                      <p>Nonetheless, it's important to note that we've encountered lenders that demand 48 monthly payments on time and in full before releasing cosigners. In this context, a 36-month waiting period seems relatively standard. However, if you wish to avoid cosigning altogether or desire a quicker path to cosigner release, this particular lender might not be your ideal choice.</p>
                                      <p>Pro – Interest Rate Reduction Opting for Private student loans from Citizens Bank grants you the potential to reduce your interest rate by up to 0.5% through simple actions. A 0.25% reduction is available if you or your cosigner possess a qualifying account with Citizens Bank. An additional 0.25% reduction is accessible for enrolling in automatic monthly payments. These combined reductions can significantly lower your already competitive interest rate.</p>
                                      <p>Con – Absence of Unemployment Protection Ultimately, while Private student loans from Citizens Bank provide diverse repayment options, they lack safeguards for unemployment or financial hardship. In the event of job loss, you'll remain responsible for your monthly loan payments. Failure to adhere to these payments will lead to collection actions, triggering default loan consequences.</p>
                                      <p>This shortfall is common among private student loans. Unlike federal loans, which typically offer deferment options during unemployment, military deployment, and other exceptional circumstances, private student loans rarely provide such leniency. However, meticulous planning and judicious savings can empower you to select a repayment plan that suits your needs.</p>
                                      <p>For instance, a 15-year repayment plan enables you to initiate regular payments (usually ranging between $90 and $110 per month) while still in school. Alternatively, you can opt to pay only the interest during your academic tenure, with post-graduation payments ranging from $91 to $118 per month. If you prefer, you can defer payments until after graduation, resulting in slightly higher interest rates and monthly payments ranging from $126 to $174.</p>
                                      <p>Multiple options exist, and Private student loans from Citizens Bank indeed offer several valuable borrower benefits. Success lies in your ability to strategize and establish arrangements to manage loan payments, even in the face of unemployment or financial adversity.</p>

                  Studiostrack.com operates as a complimentary service for users,
                  much like various other search and comparison shopping websites.
                  When a user selects a product from a partner lender or
                  advertiser, we may receive transaction or referral fees. Our
                  guiding principle centers around the values of choice and
                  transparency. To honor this principle of choice, our platform
                  incorporates a multitude of options from non-partner entities.
                  It's important to note that selecting a loan from our partners
                  does not incur any additional costs for the user. We emphasize
                  that there exist numerous alternative borrowing avenues.
                  Integrate studiostrack.com into your broader exploration of
                  college financing, enabling you to make an informed decision. In
                  this pursuit, consider leveraging federal aid options for
                  maximum benefit.

                  definitive loan terms, including any incentives or Borrower

                  The provided APR is susceptible to augmentation if the loan
                  involves a variable interest rate, and the interest rate index
                  employed to determine the APR rises. While certain loan listings
                  remain fixed-rate loans and are immune to rate hikes unless
                  otherwise specified by the lender.

                  Please be aware that borrowing amounts and limitations differ
                  depending on the lender and loan type.

                <p class="disclosure">
                  Variable rates have the potential to escalate over the loan's

                  The savings outlined are based on a typical loan extended to a
                  freshman.
                </p>

                <p class="disclosure">
                  Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are
                  higher compared to the Interest Repayment Option. Interest
                  accrual begins upon disbursement, continuing during your
                  academic term and the subsequent six-month separation or grace
                  period. As you transition into principal and interest repayment,
                  any Unpaid Interest gets added to your loan's Current Principal.
                  Variable rates also hold the potential to rise throughout the
                  loan's life. The advertised APRs are built on a $10,000 loan
                  extended to a freshman with no pre-existing loans.
                </p>

                <p class="disclosure">
                  In most instances, undergraduates can opt to postpone the
                  repayment of principal and interest on private loans until six
                  months post-graduation or upon ceasing to be enrolled at least
                  half-time. Options for immediate repayment and interest-only
                  repayment are also available. The specifics of deferment periods
                  might differ according to the lender and loan type. It's crucial
                  to confirm your lender's disbursement process and timing before
                  applying. A co-signer with favorable credit enhances the
                  likelihood of qualifying for a student loan, even with poor
                  credit history.
