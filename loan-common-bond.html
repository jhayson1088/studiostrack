                                    <h3 class="title">Can You Reduce Your Student Loan Payments with CommonBond Student Loans?</h3>

                                    <div class="desc">
                                      <p>While the economy is gradually recovering, many individuals are still feeling the financial aftermath of the housing crash in 2008. People across the United States are exploring ways to minimize debt and monthly expenses, and unfortunately, some are resorting to defaulting on their student loans to avoid repayment. Defaulting poses multiple challenges, and it's strongly advised against. Instead, we recommend considering the option of refinancing your student loans to secure lower monthly payments and better interest rates. CommonBond student loans might be a solution for you.</p>
                                      <p>Focused on graduate students, CommonBond was established in 2013 to assist students with MBAs, engineering degrees, medical degrees, and other high-cost educations in repaying their student loans as they embark on their careers in their chosen fields. According to David Klein, co-founder of CommonBond, "Our core mission is to reduce the cost of higher education."</p>
                                      <p>How Does CommonBond Student Loans Operate? As a relatively new company operating in an economy with a substantial portion of people holding existing debts, CommonBond student loans primarily emphasize refinancing. However, new students can also borrow from CommonBond. Whether you are seeking to refinance and consolidate your existing loans or aiming for a new loan to support your undergraduate or graduate studies, CommonBond is there to assist.</p>
                                      <p>According to Klein, the company's focal points are savings and community support. Their aim is to help you alleviate your debt burden. But how? To begin with, they offer refinancing services for loans up to $220,000. When you opt for refinancing, you can choose among three types of loans: fixed rate, variable rate, and hybrid. With auto payment discounts applied, variable rate loans start as low as 1.93%; fixed rate loans begin at 3.74%, and hybrid loans start at 3.99%. When compared to the current federal PLUS loan's interest rate of 7.68%, these rates are notably favorable.</p>
                                      <p>For those in need of funds for education, the savings are accessible as well. Current students can secure a loan for 100% of their tuition (minus other financial aid) at a fixed rate of either 6.24% for a 10-year repayment plan or 6.74% for a 15-year repayment plan.</p>
                                      <p>Benefits of Borrowing or Refinancing with CommonBond Apart from the remarkably low interest rates, CommonBond student loans provide several other advantages. There are no penalties for prepayment. If your goal is to expedite your debt repayment by swiftly reducing your principal amount, you can do so without concern about hidden fees that could hinder your interest savings.</p>
                                      <p>In situations of unemployment, returning to school, military deployment, or financial adversity, CommonBond offers deferment and forbearance options. Similar to federal loans and distinct from many conventional private lenders, CommonBond collaborates with you and supports you in avoiding loan default for as long as needed to regain financial stability.</p>
                                      <p>Being a relatively young company established by business professionals and investors who comprehend the impact of burdensome student debt, CommonBond remains attuned to the current economic conditions. They recognize that exorbitant interest rates and rigid repayment terms without forbearance options are no longer viable solutions.</p>
                                      <p>Refinancing and Consolidating Federal Loans Generally, we wouldn't recommend refinancing or consolidating federal student loans with a private loan. This is because the process involves converting federal loans into a single private loan, resulting in the loss of the low, fixed interest rate and the benefits associated with federal loan repayment.</p>
                                      <p>However, with CommonBond, the situation is somewhat different. Due to their emphasis on forbearance and deferment when necessary, coupled with interest rates significantly lower than even federal student loan rates, this approach can be justified. The application is conducted entirely online and takes only a few minutes. Students can promptly determine if they qualify for consolidation and refinancing, ascertain the rate applicable to them, and proceed, all within a matter of minutes.</p>
                                      <p>A Unique Model CommonBond student loans operate on investments made by individuals and corporations. Despite the low interest rates, investors experience positive returns on investment (ROIs) in a relatively short span. Through this crowdfunding-style lending and refinancing approach, CommonBond has established itself within just two years. Anticipating a growing number of students opting for refinancing and loan acquisition through CommonBond in the near future, it wouldn't be surprising to witness more lenders adopting their model in the years to come.</p>

                  Studiostrack.com operates as a complimentary service for users,
                  much like various other search and comparison shopping websites.
                  When a user selects a product from a partner lender or
                  advertiser, we may receive transaction or referral fees. Our
                  guiding principle centers around the values of choice and
                  transparency. To honor this principle of choice, our platform
                  incorporates a multitude of options from non-partner entities.
                  It's important to note that selecting a loan from our partners
                  does not incur any additional costs for the user. We emphasize
                  that there exist numerous alternative borrowing avenues.
                  Integrate studiostrack.com into your broader exploration of
                  college financing, enabling you to make an informed decision. In
                  this pursuit, consider leveraging federal aid options for
                  maximum benefit.

                  The provided APR is susceptible to augmentation if the loan
                  involves a variable interest rate, and the interest rate index
                  employed to determine the APR rises. While certain loan listings
                  remain fixed-rate loans and are immune to rate hikes unless
                  otherwise specified by the lender.

                  Please be aware that borrowing amounts and limitations differ
                  depending on the lender and loan type.

                  Variable rates have the potential to escalate over the loan's

                  The savings outlined are based on a typical loan extended to a
                  freshman.
                </p>

                <p class="disclosure">
                  Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are
                  higher compared to the Interest Repayment Option. Interest
                  accrual begins upon disbursement, continuing during your
                  academic term and the subsequent six-month separation or grace
                  period. As you transition into principal and interest repayment,
                  any Unpaid Interest gets added to your loan's Current Principal.
                  Variable rates also hold the potential to rise throughout the
                  loan's life. The advertised APRs are built on a $10,000 loan
                  extended to a freshman with no pre-existing loans.
                </p>

                <p class="disclosure">
                  In most instances, undergraduates can opt to postpone the
                  repayment of principal and interest on private loans until six
                  months post-graduation or upon ceasing to be enrolled at least
                  half-time. Options for immediate repayment and interest-only
                  repayment are also available. The specifics of deferment periods
                  might differ according to the lender and loan type. It's crucial
                  to confirm your lender's disbursement process and timing before
                  applying. A co-signer with favorable credit enhances the
                  likelihood of qualifying for a student loan, even with poor
                  credit history.
