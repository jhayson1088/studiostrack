                        <p>We will not share the Personal Information you provide except (a) as permitted by applicable law; (b) where such disclosure has been described on the Website or in this Policy or you have otherwise consented to such disclosure; (c) as a result of our belief that the disclosure may be permitted or required by law or may be necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g., in response to a court order or subpoena or law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing or may cause injury or is interfering with the rights or property of another); or (d) with third parties with which we contract to carry out our business activities (e.g., sending out a promotional item that you have qualified for on the Website, contacting you to complete your loan application, or sharing information with our business partners in connection with the operation of a loan comparison site that is powered by StudiosTrack, Inc. and operated under another brand).</p>
                        <h5>Your Consent to Disclose Personal Information to a Third Party</h5>
                        <p>Except as otherwise indicated in this Policy, we will only supply your Personal Information to a third party with your opt-in or opt-out consent.

                        <p>On this Website, when you provide us with an email address for a referral, we will share your name and email address as well as the recipient’s email address with a third party as necessary in order to provide this referral service.

You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone — not just us – -may use publicly posted information.</p>
                        <h5>Security Notice</h5>
                        <p>We maintain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to comply with federal guidance to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to, maintain data security of and correctly use the Personal Information collected through our Website.

                  Studiostrack.com operates as a complimentary service for users,
                  much like various other search and comparison shopping websites.
                  When a user selects a product from a partner lender or
                  advertiser, we may receive transaction or referral fees. Our
                  guiding principle centers around the values of choice and
                  transparency. To honor this principle of choice, our platform
                  incorporates a multitude of options from non-partner entities.
                  It's important to note that selecting a loan from our partners
                  does not incur any additional costs for the user. We emphasize
                  that there exist numerous alternative borrowing avenues.
                  Integrate studiostrack.com into your broader exploration of
                  college financing, enabling you to make an informed decision. In

                  information you provide regarding your interest in acquiring a

                  The provided APR is susceptible to augmentation if the loan
                  involves a variable interest rate, and the interest rate index
                  employed to determine the APR rises. While certain loan listings

                  Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are
                  higher compared to the Interest Repayment Option. Interest
                  accrual begins upon disbursement, continuing during your
                  academic term and the subsequent six-month separation or grace
                  period. As you transition into principal and interest repayment,
                  any Unpaid Interest gets added to your loan's Current Principal.
                  Variable rates also hold the potential to rise throughout the
                  loan's life. The advertised APRs are built on a $10,000 loan
                  extended to a freshman with no pre-existing loans.

                  months post-graduation or upon ceasing to be enrolled at least
                  half-time. Options for immediate repayment and interest-only
                  repayment are also available. The specifics of deferment periods
                  might differ according to the lender and loan type. It's crucial
                  to confirm your lender's disbursement process and timing before
                  applying. A co-signer with favorable credit enhances the
                  likelihood of qualifying for a student loan, even with poor
                  credit history.
