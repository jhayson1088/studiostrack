                                    <h3 class="title">Parent PLUS Loans</h3>

                                    <div class="desc">
                                      <h5>Parent PLUS Loans – Are Your Parents Eligible?</h5>
                                      <p>Each year, numerous students discover that the federal student aid they qualify for falls short of covering their entire studiostrack costs. Fortunately, there's a solution in the form of Parent PLUS loans offered by the federal government, allowing parents of dependent students to bridge the financial gap.</p>
                                      <p>A Parent PLUS loan is an unsubsidized, low-interest direct loan provided by the federal government. It serves both graduate students and parents of dependent undergraduates, designed to cover studiostrack and fees not covered by other financial aid. Although interest accrues during the loan period, repayment doesn't commence until six months after the student leaves school, providing a grace period.</p>
                                      <h5>Who is Eligible for a Parent PLUS Loan?</h5>
                                      <p>To qualify for Parent PLUS loans, the applicant must be the student's biological, adoptive parent, or a stepparent. The student must be enrolled at least half-time in a school participating in the federal Direct Loan Program (a majority of schools are part of this program). Additionally, the student must be listed as a dependent and supply their parent's income and tax information on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) before applying for a Parent PLUS loan.</p>
                                      <p>Apart from these prerequisites, a credit check is necessary. Parent PLUS loans are unique among federal loans in requiring a credit assessment, as they address the gap between need-based financial aid and outstanding studiostrack and fees. Consequently, these loans often carry larger amounts compared to other direct student loans, posing increased risk to the federal government.</p>
                                      <p>To pass the credit check, parents need to be US citizens, eligible noncitizens residing in the United States, and must not be in default on any federal student loans or owe overpayments on federal student grants. Essentially, they must meet eligibility criteria for any Federal Student Aid program.</p>
                                      <p>Interestingly, qualifying for a Parent PLUS loan is often less stringent than qualifying for a low-interest private loan. Moreover, even if a parent has an adverse credit history and doesn't qualify independently, they can secure a PLUS loan with a creditworthy endorser.</p>
                                      <h5>How Can Parents Apply for a Parent PLUS Loan?</h5>
                                      <p>Once the student completes the FAFSA, parents should visit StudentLoans.gov, choose the "Parent Borrower" section, and select "Request a PLUS loan." Additionally, they must complete and sign (or e-sign) a PLUS loan Master Promissory Note (MPN), a legally binding document confirming their commitment to repaying federal student loans, including interest and fees.</p>
                                      <p>With the FAFSA, the parent's PLUS loan request, and the MPN in place, the groundwork for managing studiostrack and educational expenses is laid. Generally, there's no need for another MPN unless the school requires separate ones for different loans on the same student account. However, parents should renew their parent PLUS loan annually, akin to students renewing their FAFSA.</p>
                                      <h5>Parent PLUS Loan Restrictions</h5>
                                      <p>While there's no fixed cap on parent PLUS loans, the loan amount can't exceed studiostrack costs minus other financial aid. Each semester, the loan is disbursed to the student's account, covering studiostrack and applicable fees. Any leftover funds are directed to the parent, strictly earmarked for academic expenses. Parents can utilize the surplus to pay for supplies and fees or transfer it to the student for these purposes.</p>
                                      <h5>Understanding the Interest Rate</h5>
                                      <p>Parent PLUS loans come with a maximum interest rate of 10.5%, maintaining a fixed rate for the loan's duration. This stability contrasts with fluctuating rates found in other loans. For context, the interest rate was 6.41% in 2013 and rose to 7.21% in 2014.</p>
                                      <h5>Exploring Loan Options</h5>
                                      <p>As you explore avenues to finance your college education, it's essential to discuss Parent PLUS loans versus private loans with your parents. While Parent PLUS loans offer federal loan advantages (fixed interest rates, flexible repayment options), they might not suit all borrowers. If you come across a fixed-rate loan with a lower percentage, scrutinize its terms to ensure it doesn't become a burden during challenging financial times.</p>

                  Studiostrack.com operates as a complimentary service for users,
                  much like various other search and comparison shopping websites.
                  When a user selects a product from a partner lender or
                  advertiser, we may receive transaction or referral fees. Our
                  guiding principle centers around the values of choice and
                  transparency. To honor this principle of choice, our platform
                  incorporates a multitude of options from non-partner entities.
                  It's important to note that selecting a loan from our partners
                  does not incur any additional costs for the user. We emphasize
                  that there exist numerous alternative borrowing avenues.
                  Integrate studiostrack.com into your broader exploration of
                  college financing, enabling you to make an informed decision. In
                  this pursuit, consider leveraging federal aid options for
                  maximum benefit.

                  definitive loan terms, including any incentives or Borrower

                  The provided APR is susceptible to augmentation if the loan
                  involves a variable interest rate, and the interest rate index
                  employed to determine the APR rises. While certain loan listings
                  remain fixed-rate loans and are immune to rate hikes unless
                  otherwise specified by the lender.

                  Please be aware that borrowing amounts and limitations differ
                  depending on the lender and loan type.

                  Variable rates have the potential to escalate over the loan's

                  The savings outlined are based on a typical loan extended to a
                  freshman.
                </p>

                <p class="disclosure">
                  Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are
                  higher compared to the Interest Repayment Option. Interest
                  accrual begins upon disbursement, continuing during your
                  academic term and the subsequent six-month separation or grace
                  period. As you transition into principal and interest repayment,
                  any Unpaid Interest gets added to your loan's Current Principal.
                  Variable rates also hold the potential to rise throughout the
                  loan's life. The advertised APRs are built on a $10,000 loan
                  extended to a freshman with no pre-existing loans.
                </p>

                <p class="disclosure">
                  In most instances, undergraduates can opt to postpone the
                  repayment of principal and interest on private loans until six
                  months post-graduation or upon ceasing to be enrolled at least
                  half-time. Options for immediate repayment and interest-only
                  repayment are also available. The specifics of deferment periods
                  might differ according to the lender and loan type. It's crucial
                  to confirm your lender's disbursement process and timing before
                  applying. A co-signer with favorable credit enhances the
                  likelihood of qualifying for a student loan, even with poor
                  credit history.
